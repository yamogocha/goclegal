        <span class="text-[16px] pb-8">Attorney & Founder</span>
      </div>
      <p class="text-[16px] pb-8">Greg O’Connell is a relentless advocate for justice.  Greg combines superior trial and courtroom skills with compassionate interpersonal skills to help injured individuals and families of loved ones catastrophically injured or killed by someone else's negligence.   He has more than 15 years of experience litigating high-stakes cases in the trial courts, federal courts, and courts of appeal.</p>
      <p class="text-[16px] pb-8">Greg began his legal career as a trial attorney at the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office where he prosecuted serious felonies and obtained verdicts in 35 jury trials.  During the eight years Greg served as a trial attorney in the criminal justice system, he honed courtroom-proven trial skills, poise, and knowledge of the law.  Greg is not afraid to take a case to trial in order to obtain a successful outcome for a client. </p>
      <p class="text-[16px] pb-8">After leaving the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, Greg transitioned to plaintiff’s personal injury because he wanted to help people more directly.  Greg worked for several prominent plaintiff law firms including the Dolan Law Firm and Rains Lucia Stern St. Phalle & Silver, P.C., where he made a name for himself as an aggressive and compassionate trial attorney, securing multi-million dollar settlements and verdicts for clients.</p>
      <p class="text-[16px] pb-8">Greg has now brought his extensive knowledge and experience to GOC Legal, P.C., which he founded in 2020 with the purpose of expertly representing individuals around the Bay Area who have been injured and seek full and fair justice in the courts.  He excels in all areas of litigation, from pre-trial case investigation, pre-litigation settlement offers and case strategy, to fact discovery, expert witness examination, motion practice, trial preparation, mediation, and settlement, or if necessary, trial.  Greg’s courtroom skills allow him to connect with juries to achieve significant verdicts for his personal injury clients.  Greg is an accomplished litigator in a variety of areas including auto accidents, auto vs. pedestrian accidents, premises liability, contract disputes, professional malpractice, trucking, and wrongful death.</p>
      <p class="text-[16px]">Greg is a Bay Area native and resides in Oakland with his wife and dog. He is an alumnus of UCLA and earned his law degree from Golden Gate University in San Francisco. When he is not working passionately on behalf of his clients, he enjoys playing golf, swimming, spending time with his family, discovering new local restaurants, and being a proud member of Dub Nation and the 49ers Faithful.</p>
